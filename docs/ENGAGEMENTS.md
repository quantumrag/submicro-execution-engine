# Commercial & Research Engagements

The **Sub-Microsecond Execution Engine** represents a foundational framework for high-frequency trading research. While the core repository is open for academic and educational purposes, we offer specialized engagements for institutional partners, research labs, and trading firms requiring production-grade performance and hardware-specific optimizations.

## Supported Engagements

We provide technical expertise and implementation support across the following areas:

### 1. Institutional Consulting & Implementation
*   **Custom Hardware Integration**: Implementation of kernel-bypass networking (DPDK, RDMA Verbs, Onload) for specific NIC hardware (Mellanox/NVIDIA, Solarflare/Xilinx).
*   **FPGA Acceleration**: Porting of signal extraction and order serialization logic to HLS/RTL for FPGA-based execution.
*   **Performance Audits**: Deep-dive latency analysis and bottleneck identification for existing HFT stacks.
*   **Production Hardening**: Transforming research-grade code into deterministic, fault-tolerant production systems.

### 2. Research & Academic Collaboration
*   **Market Microstructure Research**: Collaboration on multivariate Hawkes process modeling and order book imbalance features.
*   **ML-Driven Execution**: Implementation of low-latency inference pipelines for proprietary quantitative models.
*   **Benchmarking Methodologies**: Development of high-precision latency measurement frameworks and deterministic replay systems.

### 3. Custom Strategy Development
*   **Strategy Porting**: Migration of high-level quantitative models (Python/Julia) to ultra-low latency C++ (AVX-512 optimized).
*   **Risk Management Frameworks**: Implementation of pre-trade risk controls and institutional-grade kill-switches.
