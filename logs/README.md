# README: Production Log Bundle

## Structure

This directory contains institutional-grade audit logs with NO performance claims.

```
logs/
├── nic_rx_tx_hw_ts.log      # Hardware timestamps (NIC)
├── strategy_trace.log        # User-space events (TSC)
├── exchange_ack.log          # External exchange timestamps
├── ptp_sync.log              # Clock synchronization
├── order_gateway.log         # Order submission trace
├── MANIFEST.sha256           # Cryptographic integrity
└── raw_capture_20251215.pcap # Raw packets (not included - binary)
```

## Verification

```bash
# 1. Verify file integrity
sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256

# 2. Compute latencies offline
python3 ../verify_latency.py

# 3. Inspect raw PCAP (requires tcpdump)
tcpdump -r raw_capture_20251215.pcap -tt -n
```

## Principles

✓ Logs record events, not interpretations
✓ Timestamps are raw (HW ns, TSC ticks)
✓ No inline latency computations
✓ External timestamps cannot be faked
✓ Correlation happens offline
✓ PCAP proves wire truth
✓ Manifest proves integrity

✗ No performance claims
✗ No competitor comparisons
✗ No tier rankings
✗ No marketing language

## Latency Computation

Latencies are computed by `verify_latency.py` which correlates:

- NIC hardware timestamps (when packet hit wire)
- Strategy TSC values (CPU cycle counter)
- Exchange timestamps (external reality)
- PTP sync offsets (clock alignment)

This script computes:
- RX → DECISION (user-space processing)
- DECISION → TX (order preparation + NIC)
- WIRE → EXCHANGE_ACK (network + exchange)
- TOTAL RTT (end-to-end)

## Compliance

These logs are designed to survive:

- Legal discovery
- Regulatory audit (SEBI, SEC, FCA)
- Third-party verification
- Forensic timestamp analysis
- Cross-exchange correlation

## Notes

- All timestamps in nanoseconds (UTC)
- TSC values require calibration against PTP
- PCAP file omitted from git (too large, binary)
- Exchange timestamps are ground truth
- Clock drift tracked in ptp_sync.log
